# NBA Player Statistics Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze NBA player statistics and predict player positions using machine learning, specifically the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. 
The dataset includes various performance metrics for NBA players, enabling insights into player effectiveness and position classification.
As a result, the model was able to predict NBA player positions at a 75.6% accuracy using 11 of the nearest neighbors. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains player statistics from the 2022-23 NBA season, which includes metrics such as:

- MPG (Minutes Per Game)
- USG% (Usage Percentage)
- PPG (Points Per Game)
- RPG (Rebounds Per Game)
- APG (Assists Per Game)
- SPG (Steals Per Game)
- BPG (Blocks Per Game)
- ORtg (Offensive Rating)
- DRtg (Defensive Rating)

The dataset was obtained from: https://www.nbastuffer.com/2023-2024-nba-player-stats/
